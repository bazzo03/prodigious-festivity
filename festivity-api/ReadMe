Hi

You can download the projects following this link:
The GitHub Repository address is: https://github.com/bazzo03/prodigious-festivity

Here we have 1 RestFul API and 1 RestFul Client

The idea is to create Festivities, based on an defined XML file.
Inside each of the projects you will a ReadMe.txt, which will
tell you how works that specific project.

In summary applications where built using:

	Maven 3.3.9
	Java 1.8
	Spring 4.0.0
	EasyMock 3.4
	JUnit 4.10
	Hibernate 3.6.2 and 5.2.4
	Tomcat 8.0.35
	DBMS: Postgres 9.3
	Eclipse IDE
	
The client project has defined the url to post to or to get from the api as 
url to post : http://localhost:8080/festivity-api/festivity/add
url to get : http://localhost:8080/festivity-api/festivity/

If you want to change the url's , you can access to the 
com.prodigious.festivity.client.FestivityLoader.java class in the client project

In this class, is also defined the source XML to test: ./src/main/resources/festivities.xml
You will see this file already saved in the defined directory
