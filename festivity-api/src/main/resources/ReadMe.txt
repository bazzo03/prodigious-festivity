Hi!

This application was built using:

	Maven 3.3.9
	Java 1.8
	Spring 4.0.0
	EasyMock 3.4
	JUnit 4.10
	Hibernate 3.6.2 and 5.2.4
	Tomcat 8.0.35
	Eclipse IDE
	
When errors in building, please check the project Facet, Java must be 1.8, Dynamic Web Model 2.5;
also check the buildpath, must be consistent with above definitions.

Once the project is imported in your IDE, please build it with maven and then uploaded in a tomcat
server. When the tomcat is deployed, then the web service can be consumed.

If you want to try the web service using your default browser or another tool, such as Postman,
you can search in the package: com.prodigious.festivity.constant # RestEndpoint.java for the Endpoints
