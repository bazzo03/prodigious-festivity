Hi!

This application was built using:

	Maven 3.3.9
	Java 1.8
	Spring 4.0.0
	Eclipse IDE
	
When errors in building, please check the project Facet, Java must be 1.8, Dynamic Web Model 2.5;
also check the buildpath, must be consistent with above definitions.

Once the project is imported in your IDE, please build it with maven and then uploaded in a tomcat
server. When the tomcat is deployed, then the web service can be consumed.

This project is the client side of the application. Here, the XML file is loaded and parsed to a JSON, which
is sent via a RestFul web service defined in the API (festivity-api) project.

The location of the XML file is the same as this file, or you can reach it:
./src/main/resources/{your XML file to be parsed and saved}

The XML file to be used must have the syntax as follows:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
